**Python for Data Science**  
  
**Project 1:**  I built a wine inventory control system using Object-Oriented in Python. I broke up the engine component from UI. The engine contains unit test of what the UI would use. Additionally, the wine inventory and customer list are contained in separate databases (CSV), while the password is encrypted.

**Project 2:** Project 2 was a team project using Python in a Jupyter Notebook using numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly. The research questions were centered in the following areas: Degree choices, earnings, employment, university expenses, faculty, and geographical distribution. The U.S. Department of Education dataset was used (3,600 variables & over 15,000 rows) to examine these questions. (Note: Statistical validation of the questions were not performed.)  
  
**Topics included:**  
  
- Python syntax and data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples..)  
- Libraries, modules  
- Command line  
- Jupyter notebooks  
- Pandas  
- Numpy  
- Object-Oriented programming vs. functional programming  
- Lamda functions, Regex
