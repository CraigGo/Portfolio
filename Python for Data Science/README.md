**Python for Data Science**  
  
**Project 1:**  I built a wine inventory control system using Object-Oriented in Python. I broke up the engine component from UI. The engine contains unit test of what the UI would use. Additionally, the wine inventory and customer list are contained in separate databases (CSV), while the password is encrypted.  




**Project 2:** was a team exercise using Python in Jupyter Notebooks to provide some characteristics on Graduate Student Success. Libraries used were numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
  
** Topics included:**  
  
- Python syntax and data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples..)  
- Libraries, modules  
- Command line  
- Jupyter notebooks  
- Pandas  
- Numpy  
- Object-Oriented programming vs. functional programming  
- Lamda functions, Regex
