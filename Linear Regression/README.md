# Solving Business Problems using Linear Regression

A Jupyter Notebook and R was used to perform the statistical analysis on the research question in this group project. I performed the EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) as well as developed the Optimized Step Model.  
    
**Research Question:** How can North Carolina affect the crime rate by influencing police per capita and the likelihood of
conviction?  
  
The focus of the study is to generate effective and cost minimizing policy recommendations that will help politicians of North
Carolina reduce crime rate. Numerous studies demonstrate that decreasing crime rate results in increased business success
and increases probability of reelection due to improved economic conditions. This study will identify efficient ways to decrease
crime rate and serves as a starting point for future studies. Ordinary least squares regression was used to examine the
dataset to make policy suggestions and recommendations for future opportunities.  
  
**Null Hypothesis:**  
1) 'Probability' of conviction (prbconv) has no effect on crime rate.  
2) Police per capita (polpc) has no effect on crime rate.  
  
**Alternate Hypothesis:**  
1) 'Probability' of conviction (prbconv) has a statistically significant effect on crime rate.  
2) Police per capita (polpc) has a statistically significant effect on crime rate.
